Build a Power BI dashboard that empowers 𝐀𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐐’𝐬 leadership to make informed business decisions and monitor critical metrics with ease. Thrilled to present my latest venture in Power BI within the hospitality domain: 𝗔𝘁𝗹𝗶𝗤 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝗛𝗼𝘀𝗽𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀!

As part of the Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp, I embarked on creating a data-driven dashboard for 𝐀𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐐 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝, a premier luxury hotel chain in India, to address its current business hurdles. Rising competition and management challenges had impacted 𝐀𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐐’𝐬 market position, and this project aimed to help them regain their competitive edge through insightful data analysis.
